## **Module 1: Foundations of Tokenized RWAs**

### **1.1. What are Real-World Assets (RWAs)?**

Real-World Assets (RWAs) refer to tangible or intangible assets that exist outside the blockchain and are subsequently represented on-chain as digital tokens. These assets span a vast spectrum, from traditional financial instruments to physical commodities and intellectual property. The tokenization process transforms these diverse assets into programmable, divisible, and transferable digital tokens, unlocking new avenues for liquidity, transparency, and accessibility.

**Examples of RWAs include:**

* **Real Estate:** Commercial properties, residential homes, land parcels. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, making large assets accessible to a broader investor base and enhancing liquidity.  
* **Treasuries and Bonds:** Government bonds, corporate bonds, and other fixed-income securities. Tokenizing these assets can streamline issuance, settlement, and transfer processes, reducing intermediaries and costs.  
* **Commodities:** Gold, silver, oil, agricultural products. Tokenization can simplify ownership, storage, and trading of these physical assets.  
* **Equities:** Shares in private or public companies.  
* **Art and Collectibles:** Fine art, rare wines, luxury goods.  
* **Intellectual Property:** Music royalties, patents, copyrights.  
* **Private Credit:** Loans, invoices, and other forms of private debt.

### **1.2. Why Tokenize? The Transformative Potential**

The tokenization of RWAs is driven by several compelling advantages that address the limitations of traditional asset management and transfer. These benefits collectively contribute to a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem.

* **Enhanced Liquidity:** Many traditional assets, such as real estate or private equity, are inherently illiquid. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, enabling investors to buy and sell smaller portions of an asset, thereby increasing its market depth and accessibility. This fractionalization can unlock capital previously trapped in illiquid markets.  
* **Increased Transparency:** Blockchain technology provides an immutable and auditable record of ownership and transactions. This inherent transparency reduces information asymmetry, minimizes fraud, and builds trust among participants. For instance, the provenance and ownership history of a tokenized asset can be easily verified on-chain.  
* **Programmability:** Tokens are programmable assets, meaning their behavior can be automated through smart contracts. This enables features like automated dividend distributions, collateral management, and compliance checks, reducing manual processes and operational overhead. Programmability also facilitates the creation of complex financial products and derivatives built on top of tokenized RWAs.  
* **Reduced Costs and Friction:** By disintermediating traditional financial processes, tokenization can significantly lower transaction fees, administrative costs, and settlement times. The peer-to-peer nature of blockchain transactions eliminates the need for numerous intermediaries, leading to a more streamlined and cost-effective ecosystem.  
* **Global Accessibility:** Blockchain networks are permissionless and globally accessible, allowing investors from anywhere in the world to participate in markets that were previously restricted by geographical boundaries or stringent accreditation requirements. This broadens the investor base and fosters greater financial inclusion.  
* **Faster Settlement:** Traditional asset transfers can take days or even weeks to settle. Blockchain-based token transfers can settle in minutes or seconds, significantly improving capital efficiency and reducing counterparty risk.

### **1.3. Key Stakeholders in the Tokenized RWA Ecosystem**

The tokenized RWA ecosystem involves a diverse set of participants, each playing a crucial role in the lifecycle of these digital assets.

* **Issuers:** Entities that originate and tokenize real-world assets. This can include real estate developers, financial institutions, corporations, or even individuals. Issuers are responsible for the legal structuring, compliance, and initial issuance of the tokens.  
* **Custodians:** Specialized entities responsible for securely holding the underlying real-world assets or their legal claims. Custodians can range from traditional banks and trust companies to specialized digital asset custodians. Their role is critical in ensuring the physical or legal backing of the tokens.  
* **Investors:** Individuals or institutions who purchase and hold tokenized RWAs. This includes retail investors, institutional funds, family offices, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  
* **Protocols and Platforms:** The blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and tokenization platforms that facilitate the creation, management, and trading of tokenized RWAs. Examples include Ethereum, Polygon, Centrifuge, and Goldfinch.  
* **Regulators:** Government bodies and financial authorities responsible for establishing legal frameworks, licensing requirements, and overseeing the RWA market to ensure investor protection and market integrity.  
* **Service Providers:** A broad category including legal firms, audit firms, oracle providers, KYC/AML solution providers, and market makers who support various aspects of the RWA ecosystem.

### **1.4. Market Outlook: The Trillion-Dollar Opportunity**

The tokenized RWA market is poised for exponential growth, with projections indicating a multi-trillion-dollar valuation in the coming years. Major financial institutions and consulting firms have highlighted the immense potential of this convergence between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

* **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and ADDX:** A report by BCG and ADDX projects that the tokenization of global illiquid assets could reach **$16 trillion by 2030** \[1\]. This forecast underscores the significant shift towards digital asset representation across various asset classes.  
* **Citi GPS:** Citi's

Global Perspectives & Solutions (GPS) report, "Money, Tokens, and Games: The Future of Digital Currencies and Assets," also emphasizes the transformative potential of tokenization, suggesting a significant portion of the world's financial assets could be tokenized in the near future \[2\].

These projections highlight the growing recognition of tokenization as a powerful tool to enhance efficiency, liquidity, and accessibility across diverse asset classes. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional adoption accelerates, tokenized RWAs are expected to become a cornerstone of the future financial landscape.

## **Module 2: Legal & Regulatory Dimension**

### **2.1. Jurisdictions and Regulatory Frameworks**

The legal and regulatory landscape for tokenized RWAs is complex and evolving, varying significantly across different jurisdictions. Understanding these frameworks is paramount, as regulatory clarity directly impacts institutional adoption and market maturity. Projects operating in jurisdictions with well-defined regulations tend to inspire greater confidence and attract more traditional capital.

**Key Regulatory Frameworks and Jurisdictions:**

* **United States (US):** The US employs a fragmented regulatory approach, with various agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, OCC) asserting jurisdiction over different aspects of digital assets.  
    
  * **Regulation D (Reg D):** Often utilized for private offerings of securities, allowing companies to raise capital without registering with the SEC, provided certain conditions are met. Many tokenized RWA projects targeting accredited investors use Reg D exemptions.  
  * **State-level Regulations:** Individual states also have their own securities laws (Blue Sky Laws) that may apply.


* **European Union (EU):** The EU is moving towards a more unified approach with comprehensive legislation.  
    
  * **Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation:** A landmark regulatory framework designed to create a harmonized legal framework for crypto-assets across the EU. MiCA aims to provide legal certainty for crypto-asset issuers and service providers, covering aspects like authorization, operational requirements, and consumer protection. Its implementation is expected to significantly boost RWA tokenization within the EU \[3\].


* **Switzerland:** Known for its progressive stance on blockchain and digital assets, Switzerland has established a clear legal framework, particularly through its Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Act.  
    
  * **FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority):** Provides guidance and licenses for blockchain-based businesses, fostering an environment conducive to innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance.


* **Singapore:** A leading financial hub, Singapore has adopted a pragmatic approach to digital asset regulation.  
    
  * **Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS):** Has issued licenses under its Payment Services Act and provides regulatory clarity for various digital asset activities, including security token offerings.


* **Argentina:** While still developing, countries like Argentina are exploring regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including those related to real assets.  
    
  * **Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV):** Argentina's securities regulator, which has been exploring regulations for crypto assets and tokenized securities.

### **2.2. Why Legal Clarity Equals Adoption**

Institutional investors, traditional financial firms, and large corporations prioritize regulatory certainty. The absence of clear legal frameworks creates significant risks, including potential reclassification of assets, legal liabilities, and operational uncertainties. Conversely, projects operating within well-defined regulatory perimeters benefit from:

* **Reduced Regulatory Risk:** Clear rules minimize the likelihood of future enforcement actions or changes in legal status that could disrupt operations.  
* **Investor Confidence:** Institutions are more likely to invest in assets that are legally sound and compliant, as this aligns with their internal risk management and compliance mandates.  
* **Market Access:** Regulatory compliance often opens doors to broader distribution channels, including traditional financial markets and regulated exchanges.  
* **Operational Stability:** A predictable regulatory environment allows projects to plan long-term strategies and build sustainable business models without constant fear of regulatory shifts.

### **2.3. Common Red Flags in the Legal Dimension**

Identifying legal red flags is a critical component of RWA project assessment. These indicators can signal significant risks that may impact the project's viability and investor protection.

* **No Disclosures or Vague Documentation:** A lack of comprehensive legal documentation, terms and conditions, or whitepapers, or documentation that is intentionally vague or ambiguous, is a major red flag. Investors should be able to clearly understand the legal rights and obligations associated with the token.  
* **Undefined or Unregistered Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs):** Many RWA tokenization structures involve an SPV that holds the underlying assets. If the SPV's legal status is unclear, unregistered in relevant jurisdictions, or its relationship with the token issuer is opaque, it poses a significant risk.  
* **Ongoing Lawsuits or Regulatory Investigations:** Any history of legal disputes, regulatory enforcement actions, or ongoing investigations against the issuer, its founders, or the project itself, indicates a heightened risk profile. This suggests potential non-compliance or questionable past conduct.  
* **Jurisdictional Arbitrage with Weak Oversight:** Projects deliberately choosing jurisdictions with minimal or no regulatory oversight solely to avoid compliance obligations. While some regulatory sandboxes can be beneficial, a pattern of avoiding established legal frameworks is concerning.  
* **Lack of KYC/AML Procedures:** Inadequate or non-existent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. This not only exposes the project to illicit finance risks but also signals a disregard for global financial compliance standards.  
* **Unclear Asset Ownership:** If the legal ownership of the underlying real-world asset is not clearly transferred to or held by the SPV or a trustee for the benefit of token holders, the entire backing mechanism is compromised.

**Practice:**  
Compare two tokenized projects: one launched in the US under Reg D vs. one offshore with no licensing. Which is more index-eligible and why?

## **Module 3: Custody & Financial Backing**

### **3.1. Proof-of-Backing: Ensuring Asset Integrity**

Proof-of-Backing (PoB) refers to the mechanisms and processes used to verify that a tokenized RWA is genuinely backed by its stated underlying asset. This is arguably the most critical aspect of RWA tokenization, as it directly addresses the trust assumption between the digital token and its real-world counterpart. Without robust PoB, a tokenized RWA is merely an empty promise.

**Types of Proof-of-Backing Mechanisms:**

* **On-chain Proof-of-Reserve (PoR):** The gold standard for transparency and real-time verification. This involves cryptographic proofs and/or direct integration with on-chain data sources (e.g., Chainlink Proof of Reserve) that continuously attest to the existence and value of the underlying assets. For example, a stablecoin backed by fiat currency might use a PoR mechanism to show its bank reserves in real-time on a blockchain \[4\].  
* **Third-Party Attestations:** Independent third-party auditors or fiduciaries periodically verify the underlying assets and issue attestations or reports. While less frequent than on-chain PoR, these attestations provide a level of assurance, especially for assets that are difficult to track on-chain (e.g., physical real estate).  
* **Quarterly Audits/Reports:** Regular, typically quarterly, audits conducted by reputable accounting firms. These reports provide a snapshot of the asset backing at a specific point in time. While valuable, they lack the real-time transparency of on-chain PoR and may have a time lag.  
* **Legal Trust Structures:** The underlying assets are held in a legal trust or similar fiduciary arrangement, with the token holders as beneficiaries. The trust deed outlines the responsibilities of the trustee and the rights of the token holders.

### **3.2. Custodians: The Guardians of Real-World Assets**

Custodians are entities responsible for the safekeeping and management of the physical or legal underlying assets that back the token. The choice and reputation of the custodian are paramount, as they directly influence the security and trustworthiness of the tokenized RWA.

**Types of Custodians:**

* **Banks and Trust Companies:** Traditional financial institutions with extensive experience in asset custody, regulatory oversight, and robust security infrastructure. These are often preferred for their established reputation and compliance frameworks.  
* **Specialized Digital Asset Custodians:** Firms that specialize in securing digital assets, often employing advanced cryptographic techniques and multi-signature wallets. While primarily focused on crypto, some are expanding into RWA custody.  
* **Warehouses/Vaults:** For physical commodities like gold or art, specialized secure storage facilities act as custodians. Verification of assets in these facilities is crucial.  
* **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations):** In some experimental or fully decentralized RWA projects, a DAO might collectively manage the custody of assets or the process of verifying them. This model introduces unique governance and security considerations.

**Factors to Evaluate in a Custodian:**

* **Regulatory Status:** Is the custodian regulated and licensed in relevant jurisdictions?  
* **Insurance:** Does the custodian carry adequate insurance to cover potential losses?  
* **Security Measures:** What physical and cybersecurity measures are in place to protect the assets?  
* **Track Record:** What is the custodian's history and reputation in the industry?  
* **Segregation of Assets:** Are client assets segregated from the custodian's own assets?

### **3.3. Financial Fundamentals: Collateralization and Redemption**

Beyond just proof of backing, the financial structure and redemption mechanisms are vital for the stability and reliability of tokenized RWAs.

* **Collateralization Ratio:** For debt-backed RWAs or those involving over-collateralization, this ratio indicates the value of the underlying collateral relative to the value of the issued tokens. A higher ratio generally implies greater security.  
* **Redemption Rights:** Token holders should have clear and enforceable rights to redeem their tokens for the underlying assets or their equivalent value. The absence of clear redemption rights can render the token a mere speculative instrument rather than a true representation of an RWA.  
* **Redemption Process:** The process for redemption should be transparent, efficient, and clearly outlined. This includes details on fees, timelines, and any conditions or limitations. An overly complex or opaque redemption process can deter investors and signal potential issues.  
* **Audit Frequency and Quality:** Regular, independent audits of the underlying assets and the custodian's operations are crucial. The frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) and the reputation of the auditing firm (e.g., Big Four accounting firms) significantly impact the trustworthiness of the PoB.

**Practice:**  
Take an example: a token backed by $10M real estate with quarterly PDF reports only. Identify risks compared to one with live onchain PoR.

## **Module 4: On-Chain Analytics & Token Design**

### **4.1. Smart Contract Standards and Architecture**

The foundation of any tokenized RWA lies in its smart contract. The choice of token standard and the architecture of the smart contract significantly impact the token's functionality, security, and interoperability within the broader blockchain ecosystem.

**Common Smart Contract Standards:**

* **ERC-20:** The most prevalent standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum. It defines basic functionalities like `transfer`, `balanceOf`, and `approve`, making it widely compatible with wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols. Many tokenized RWAs, especially those representing fungible assets like stablecoins or tokenized bonds, utilize ERC-20 \[5\].  
* **ERC-721:** The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique and represents a distinct asset. This is suitable for tokenizing unique RWAs like individual pieces of art, specific real estate properties, or unique collectibles \[6\].  
* **ERC-4626:** A standard for tokenized vaults, designed to optimize and standardize the process of depositing and withdrawing tokens from yield-bearing vaults. While not a primary RWA token standard itself, it can be used to wrap or integrate RWA tokens into DeFi yield strategies \[7\].  
* **ERC-3643 (Security Token Standard):** Specifically designed for security tokens, incorporating features necessary for regulatory compliance, such as transfer restrictions, whitelisting, and investor identity management. This standard is crucial for RWA projects that fall under securities regulations, enabling programmatic enforcement of legal requirements on-chain \[8\].

**Smart Contract Architecture Considerations:**

* **Modularity:** Well-designed contracts are modular, allowing for easier upgrades, maintenance, and auditing.  
* **Upgradeability:** While providing flexibility, upgradeable contracts introduce a centralization risk if not governed properly. The mechanism for upgrades (e.g., multi-sig, DAO governance) should be transparent and secure.  
* **Pausability:** The ability to pause contract functions can be a security feature (e.g., during an attack) but also a centralization risk if controlled by a single entity. The conditions and governance for pausing should be clear.

### **4.2. Token Models: Functionality and Economics**

The token model defines the economic behavior and utility of the token within its ecosystem.

* **Fixed Supply Tokens:** Tokens with a predetermined maximum supply, often used for assets like gold or limited-edition collectibles. Their value is influenced by scarcity.  
* **Yield-Bearing Tokens:** Tokens that automatically accrue yield or rewards, often derived from the underlying RWA (e.g., interest from tokenized bonds, rental income from tokenized real estate). ERC-4626 is particularly relevant here.  
* **Rebasing Tokens:** Tokens whose supply automatically adjusts based on certain conditions (e.g., to maintain a peg to an underlying asset). This can affect the number of tokens held by users without changing their proportional ownership.  
* **Governance Tokens:** Tokens that grant holders voting rights on key decisions related to the RWA project, such as protocol upgrades, fee structures, or asset management.

### **4.3. On-Chain Activity and Composability**

The level of on-chain activity and the token's composability within the broader DeFi ecosystem are indicators of its utility, liquidity, and integration.

* **Liquidity Pools:** The presence and depth of liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) indicate the ease with which the token can be traded without significant price impact.  
* **Slippage:** A measure of how much the execution price of a trade deviates from the expected price due to insufficient liquidity. Lower slippage is desirable.  
* **Composability:** The ability of the token to seamlessly integrate with other DeFi protocols (e.g., lending platforms, yield aggregators, derivatives markets). Highly composable tokens benefit from network effects and increased utility.  
* **On-chain Volume:** The total value of transactions involving the token on the blockchain, indicating its usage and adoption.

### **4.4. Oracle Dependencies & Risks**

Many tokenized RWAs rely on oracles to bring off-chain data (e.g., asset prices, audit reports, legal statuses) onto the blockchain. The security and reliability of these oracles are paramount.

* **Oracle Design:** Decentralized oracle networks (DONs) like Chainlink are preferred over single-point-of-failure oracles. The oracle's data sources, aggregation methods, and update frequency should be robust.  
* **Oracle Risks:**  
  * **Data Manipulation:** Risk of malicious actors feeding incorrect data to the oracle.  
  * **Liveness Failure:** Oracle failing to provide updates, leading to stale data.  
  * **Centralization:** Over-reliance on a single oracle provider or a small set of nodes.

**Practice:**  
Check a token’s contract on Etherscan (choose any RWA token). Identify if it’s upgradeable or pausable, what does this mean for risk scoring?

## **Module 5: Building an RWA Scoring Report**

### **5.1. Scorly’s Multi-Factor Scoring Model in Practice**

This module brings together all the concepts learned, demonstrating how Scorly’s AI-powered multi-factor scoring model systematically evaluates tokenized RWA projects. The model assesses projects across six core dimensions, each contributing to a comprehensive final score.

**The Six Core Dimensions (and their respective weights):**

1. **Legal & Regulatory Clarity (20%):** Assesses compliance, legal structure, disclosures, KYC/AML, and legal opinions.  
2. **Custody & Proof of Backing (20%):** Evaluates custodian type, proof-of-reserve mechanisms, audit quality, and redemption processes.  
3. **Token Design & Issuance (15%):** Examines token standards, mint/burn logic, oracle reliance, and token utility.  
4. **Liquidity & Market Access (15%):** Analyzes exchange listings, TVL, trading volume, slippage, and composability.  
5. **Issuer Reputation & History (10%):** Considers team background, funding, and transparency.  
6. **Infrastructure Security (10%):** Focuses on smart contract audits, upgradeability, and oracle security.

Each dimension is further broken down into weighted sub-criteria, allowing for a granular and nuanced assessment. The model aggregates scores from these sub-criteria to produce a score for each main category, which then contributes to the overall total score.

### **5.2. Risk Flags & Penalty System**

Beyond the positive scoring criteria, Scorly’s model incorporates a crucial **penalty system** for identified risk factors. These

risk flags are critical blockers or severe deficiencies that can significantly detract from a project's overall viability, regardless of its strengths in other areas. When a risk flag is identified, a percentage-based deduction is applied to the total score.

**Examples of Risk Flags:**

* **Security Breaches or Hacks:** Any history of smart contract exploits, protocol hacks, or significant security vulnerabilities.  
* **Regulatory Actions or Lawsuits:** Ongoing or past legal disputes, investigations, or enforcement actions against the project or its key personnel.  
* **Poor Architectural Design:** Fundamental flaws in the technical design (e.g., excessive centralization, single points of failure) or legal structuring (e.g., unclear asset ownership).  
* **Lack of Transparency:** Opaque operations, undisclosed team members, or a consistent failure to communicate vital information to the community.  
* **Centralization Risks:** Over-reliance on a single entity or small group for critical functions (e.g., asset custody, smart contract upgrades, oracle data).

The severity of each risk flag (e.g., Low, Medium, High) determines the magnitude of the penalty, ensuring that more critical issues lead to a greater reduction in score.

### **5.3. How to Interpret Scores: Index Inclusion Recommendations**

The final percentage-based score provides a clear, quantitative measure of a project's health and suitability. Scorly's model translates this score into actionable recommendations for index inclusion or general assessment:

* **85% \- 100% (Include):** Projects in this range demonstrate exceptional quality, robust compliance, strong security, and clear market potential. They are highly recommended for inclusion in RWA indexes, institutional portfolios, and broad platform listings. These projects typically exhibit best practices across all dimensions and have minimal to no significant risk flags.  
* **60% \- 84% (Conditional Inclusion / Monitor):** Projects within this range possess solid fundamentals but may have some areas for improvement, minor risks, or nascent development in certain dimensions. They are suitable for conditional inclusion, often requiring ongoing monitoring, specific remediation efforts, or a more cautious approach to investment. This category allows for growth and development while acknowledging existing challenges.  
* **\< 60% (Exclude / Needs Significant Improvement):** Projects falling below 60% exhibit significant deficiencies, critical risk flags, or a general lack of maturity across multiple dimensions. These projects are not recommended for inclusion in indexes or institutional portfolios and require substantial restructuring or remediation before reconsideration. They may pose high risks to investors due to legal uncertainties, weak backing, security vulnerabilities, or poor team track records.

### **5.4. Case Study: Tokenized U.S. Treasury vs. Tokenized Private Credit Loan**

To illustrate the application of Scorly's model, let's consider two hypothetical RWA projects:

**Case Study 1: Tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills**

* **Asset:** Short-term U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)  
* **Issuer:** A regulated financial institution in the US.  
* **Custody:** T-Bills held by a major US-chartered bank, with real-time on-chain Proof-of-Reserve via Chainlink.  
* **Token Standard:** ERC-20, non-upgradeable, with mint/burn controlled by the regulated issuer.  
* **Liquidity:** Listed on major centralized exchanges and integrated into several DeFi lending protocols.  
* **Team:** Publicly known team with extensive experience in traditional finance and blockchain.  
* **Risk Flags:** None identified.

**Scorly's Assessment (Expected):**

* **Legal & Regulatory:** High score due to US regulation, regulated issuer, and clear legal opinions.  
* **Custody & PoB:** Very high score due to regulated custodian and real-time on-chain PoR.  
* **Token Design:** High score for standard ERC-20, non-upgradeable, and clear mint/burn.  
* **Liquidity:** High score due to broad exchange listings and DeFi integration.  
* **Issuer Reputation:** High score for regulated institution and experienced team.  
* **Infrastructure Security:** High score due to non-upgradeable contract and robust oracle.  
* **Overall Score:** Likely in the **85-100% (Include)** range, reflecting high confidence and low risk.

**Case Study 2: Tokenized Private Credit Loan**

* **Asset:** A pool of unsecured private credit loans to small businesses.  
* **Issuer:** A newly formed DAO operating offshore with limited regulatory clarity.  
* **Custody:** Loans managed by a multi-sig wallet controlled by anonymous DAO members; proof-of-backing relies on quarterly PDF reports from an unaudited third-party.  
* **Token Standard:** Custom ERC-20 with upgradeable contracts controlled by a centralized admin key.  
* **Liquidity:** Only available on a single, small decentralized exchange with low trading volume.  
* **Team:** Anonymous team, no public track record, self-funded.  
* **Risk Flags:** Lack of Transparency (High Severity), Centralization Risks (High Severity), Poor Architectural Design (Medium Severity).

**Scorly's Assessment (Expected):**

* **Legal & Regulatory:** Low score due to offshore jurisdiction, limited clarity, and no licensing.  
* **Custody & PoB:** Very low score due to anonymous custody, reliance on unaudited PDF reports, and unclear redemption.  
* **Token Design:** Medium score for custom ERC-20, but low for centralized upgradeability and single-source oracle.  
* **Liquidity:** Low score due to limited exchange listings and low volume.  
* **Issuer Reputation:** Very low score for anonymous team and self-funding.  
* **Infrastructure Security:** Low score due to no audits and centralized admin key.  
* **Overall Score:** Likely in the **\< 60% (Exclude)** range, heavily penalized by multiple high-severity risk flags, indicating significant risks and unsuitability for broad investment.

**Practice:**
